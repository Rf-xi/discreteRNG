# discreteRNG

### A C++ library for generating discrete random numbers according to the Zipf-Mandelbrot distrbution.

## Zipf-Mandelbrot

The Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution finds uses in many applications. The general form of the probability mass function is:


> `f(k;N,q,s) = 1/( H(N,q,s)*(k+q)^s )`

where

> `H(N,q,s) = sum_(n=1)^(N) 1/(n+q)^s`

and, 

> ` s,N > 1 and q >= 0`


When `q = 0` this becomes the mass function for Zipf's Law

When `N -> infinity` this becomes the Hurwitz Zeta mass function

When `N -> infinity and q = 0`, this becomes the Riemann Zeta mass function


## Algorithm

The approach taken here is to generate a table of probabilities according to the paramaters N, q and s, and then use a general purpose algorithm for generating discrete random numbers.

All classes  are designed to work within the C++11 standard framework for Pseudo-random number generation.

## Classes

`rng::zipf_mandelbrot_distribution`: A template class for creating the random numbers. It takes as input, the values for N, q and s, and, as template parameter, a class for creating discrete random numbers. Although this class can work with, `std::discrete_distribution`, from C++11, we provide two other templates that are more efficient.

`rng::discrete_distribution`:  A class using Walker's histogram algorithm to generate discrete random numbers. The tables are created using Vose's algorithm.

`rng::discrete_distribution_30bit`: This class uses the MTW (Marsaglia, Tsang and Wang) algorithm for creating the discrete random numbers. As the name suggests, the probabilities are limited to 30 bit accuracy.

`rng::discrete_distribution_30bit` is about four times faster than `rng::discrete_distribution` when generating random deviates, but needs much longer for the initiation. Both classes are faster than `std::discrete_distribution`.

`rng::well_1024`: A uniform, 32 bit, psuedo random number generator with a period of 2^1024. The Well algorith thermalizes quicker than Matsumoto and Nishimura's Mercene twister. `rng::well_1024` is faster than some implementations of `std::mersenne_twister`.

## Tests and example usage

The directory **ran_test** contains a test program which demonstrates how to use the classes together with the C++11 framework for psuedo random number generation.
